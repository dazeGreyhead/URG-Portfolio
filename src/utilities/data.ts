I really like Clive Owen who was a surprise to see in such a high concept movie. I wish he did more stuff like this. Nonetheless, this movie is quite a ride.",

But yeah, a lot of memories, a lot of lessons and it just scratches that specific itch for a competitive ownage that can be had in such games. And the losses are brutal but that's just another life lesson in just another game.",

I don't think anything really comes close to that. It could be nostalgia doing the heavy lifting here but it sure is special and I hope I may some day be able to give that same feeling to someone else through my work or maybe I'll buy a pc for my future child and he or she will someday experience that.",

I remember loading up a previous save because Tali, a companion, commited suicide because of my decision. Felt kinda like my friend died. Yup, I'll forgive the game for the shit 3 final color lame endings. The journey was very worthwhile and immensely enjoyable.",

Somehow I had higher expectations for RPGs. Well Witcher 2 came along and blew me away. Such good graphics and story. Then witcher 3 released and became incredibly big and for a good reason. CDPR knocked it out of the park.",
